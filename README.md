# Technology Stack

  

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

  

- [Ant design](https://ant.design/)

- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Tools and Libraries

-   [Redux-Tool-Kit] - State Management
-   [Sentry] - Error Tracking
-   [Cypress] - End to End testing
-   [Chart Js] - Charts
